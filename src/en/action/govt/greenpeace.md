# {{ title }}
Government action is absolutely required if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and switch to a more sustainable energy generation mix. A failure (or even a delay) to adjust has the potential to hurt Taiwan environmentally, as well as economically.

Voting for representatives who take climate change seriously is one way to push for action. It shows legislators that climate is an important issue to their electorate (and it's the electorate that's responsible for keeping them in office). Foreigners in Taiwan can also help by joining online petitions that push for change, and by starting conversations with their Taiwanese friends & colleagues.
