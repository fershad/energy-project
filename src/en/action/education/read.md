Whether in paperback form, or digital, books provide a deep wealth of knowledge that you can take in and process at your own pace.

Below are some of the books that have helped me understand the climate emergency we're facing, what role our actions are playing in it, and how we can turn things around.

I'd love to add to this list. So, if you have any book recommendations send them through!
