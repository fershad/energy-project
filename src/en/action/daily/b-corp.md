How and where we spend our money is one of the biggest signals we, as consumers, can send to businesses. As more companies commit to sustainability and net zero emissions, supporting them with your dollars can send a message to other organisations that these factors matter.

One way to identify purpose-driven companies is by looking for [B Corp certification](https://bcorporation.net/). B Corporation (B Corp) certification is private certification that aimed at identifying profit-seeking companies that seek to maximise social & environmental performance. The program assesses a companyâ€™s overall impact across five dimensions of governance, workers, environment, community, and customers.

Over 800 B Corps have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to [net zero by 2030](https://www.bcorpclimatecollective.org/net-zero-2030). Among that is 10 companies from Taiwan.

Support purpose-driven companies, especially those who are committed to net zero emissions.
